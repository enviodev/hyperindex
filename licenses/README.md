# Licensing Information

## Overview

Envio's licensing reflects open source ethos but is not OSI recognized. Developers can use Envio's services without vendor lock-in, either by self-hosting or specifying an RPC URL. The generated code is open and public and so is this repository that generates the generated code.

Our licenses allows self-hosting but restricts third-party hosting with Envio's hosted service. Envio may consider open-sourcing in the future but prioritizes stakeholder interests and market traction. Please reach out to us on discord if you would like to explore hosting indexers as a third-party.

## TL;DR

- **Envio's licensing** mirrors open source benefits but is not OSI recognized.
- **Developers** can use Envio's services without vendor lock-in by:
  - Self-hosting.
  - Specifying an RPC URL.
- **Code** is open and public.
- **Generated license** allows self-hosting but restricts third-party competition.
- **Code generator license** is a commercial license.
- **Future considerations** for open-sourcing are dependent on market traction and stakeholder interests.

## Our Position

We're developers who value the open source ethos, which is why our licensing mirrors many benefits of open source licensing. However, Envio and its products do not use a recognized open source license by the OSI. We are public and open, and our licensing reflects this.

Our future business model lies in our hosted service and HyperSync requests, and we are protecting this. To ensure continuity and avoid vendor lock-in, developers can run and develop on their indexer without our hosted service. This can be achieved either by self-hosting, which our license permits, or by specifying an RPC URL in their indexer configuration, thus bypassing HyperSync.

Envio is in its formative stages. Although we may consider open-sourcing the software in the future, we are committed to ensuring the best interests of all stakeholders. Going open source is somewhat of a one-way function; it's easier to open source than to go "closed source." Once we have gained more market traction, we will review our position on going open source.
