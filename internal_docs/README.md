## Essential points to remember:
- **Code is King**: Always assume these docs are out of date. The codebase is the definitive source of truth, NOT THE DOCS.
- **Purpose of Documentation**: These docs are designed to aid in understanding, onboarding new team members, and to help inform technical decisions. They are not exhaustive and should not replace hands-on experience with the codebase.
- **Not for Public Consumption**: This documentation is for internal use only. It contains proprietary information and should not be shared outside of our organization.
- **Continuous Evolution**: As our product and technology evolve, so will our code. Documentation might not always keep pace with rapid changes.
- **Feedback Loop**: If you spot discrepancies or areas of improvement in the documentation, please provide feedback. This is a collaborative effort, and your insights are valuable.
- **Limitations**: While we strive for accuracy, remember that no documentation can capture the intricacies and nuances of the actual code. Always refer to the code for the most detailed and up-to-date information.
- **Use with Caution**: Relying solely on this documentation without cross-referencing the code can lead to misunderstandings. Always validate any assumptions with the actual codebase.
- **See it, say it, sort it**: (London Underground) - The docs will work best if everyone actively contributes.
- **Be concise**: Please avoid long wafty paragraphs - bullet points are great.
- **TODOs are ok**: Please use TODOs in the docs like we do in the code. If there are features we want in the code that 
- **Not a place for discussion**: Keep discussions in github discussions (or sometimes in discord - although less searchable than github discussions) - link to the discussion from docs if relevant, but remember *be concise*.
- Keep docs up to date with major code changes.
