- Always use ReScript 11 documentation.
- Never suggest ReasonML syntax.
- Never use `[| item |]` to create an array. Use `[ item ]` instead.
- Must always use `=` for setting value to a field. Use `:=` only for ref values created using `ref` function.
- ReScript has record types which require a type definition before hand. You can access record fields by dot like `foo.myField`:
```rescript
type foo = {
  myField: string
}

fooValue.myField
```
- It's also possible to define an inline object, it'll have quotedfields in this case:
```rescript
let objValue = {
  "myField": "value",
}
let fieldValue = objValue["myField"]
```
- Use records when working with a structured data, and objects to conviniently pass payload data between functions.
- Never use %raw to access object fields if you know the type.
