- Always use ReScript 11 documentation.
- Never suggest ReasonML syntax.
- Never use `[| item |]` to create an array. Use `[ item ]` instead.
- Must always use `=` for setting value to a field. Use `:=` only for ref values created using `ref` function.
- ReScript has record types which require a type definition before hand. You can access record fields by dot like `foo.myField`:
```rescript
type foo = {
  myField: string
}

fooValue.myField
```
- It's also possible to define an inline object, it'll have quotedfields in this case:
```rescript
let objValue = {
  "myField": "value",
}
let fieldValue = objValue["myField"]
```
- Use records when working with a structured data, and objects to conviniently pass payload data between functions.
- Never use %raw to access object fields if you know the type.

## Testing Best Practices

- Never use `Js.Console.log` in test files. Use `Assert` module for all verifications.
- Tests should be silent unless they fail - rely on assertions rather than logging.
- When testing with multiple iterations, collect results in data structures and assert on them.
- Use try/catch as expressions instead of refs for tracking success/failure:
  ```rescript
  let succeeded = try {
    // operations that might fail
    true
  } catch {
  | _ => false
  }
  ```
